The results from the LSTM and Markov regression models are contained here. A markov_matlab folder containing the processed indicator data was here, but cant be put in a public GitHub repo for copyright reasons.

## lstm
Test results and keras summary for the different trained LSTM models

## markov_collected
The smoothed probabilities by train/test split year as well as the collected out-of-sample test probabilites

## markov_models
.mat files describing the different trained markov models
