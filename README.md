Code used for my masters thesis 

## Overview
The code and and some of the results data divided into 5 folders with the following contents. The folders have their own readme files with further explanations. A data folder is also referred to in some of the code. For copyright reasons this data could not be uploaded to a public GitHub repository. The process in obtaining the data is explained in the thesis.

### notebooks

### scripts
Scripts which were ran on IDUN in order to process data and obtain results. Jobs which needed more power or took to long to run in Jupyter notebooks are placed here.

### slurms
Some of the different slurm job specification files which were used to run jobs on IDUN

### time_periods
The different defined time periods which were used to select data for training and testing.
